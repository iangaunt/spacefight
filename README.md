# iangaunt/spacefight

A terminal space-shooter game made with ASCII characters. It currently contains a player character who can shoot projectiles at enemies, who will explode in a fiery blast using a custom particle system.

The game can be edited in the `main.cpp` file to change the width and height of the board. It can be played by running the `spacefight.exe` exectuable (don't worry, it is completely safe :] ).
